In this study, we explore what extent urban and rural built-up land expansion has contributed to habitat losses of endangered species from 1990 to 2020. Our data calculation results include two parts: 

i) Habitat ranges of different endangered species were calculated based on habitat ranges of endangered species provided by International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), Landsat-derived annual China land cover dataset (CLCD) and DEM data. 

ii) Location of species habitat loss due to urban and rural expansion from 1990 to 2020 based on CLCD and habitat range calculation.
